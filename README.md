# RAG-Based-Assistant-Platform
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with intelligent query routing across multiple specialized agents, including a calculator, dictionary, and document-based QA system. It dynamically selects the optimal tool based on query intent and provides contextual, explainable answers through a Streamlit interface.
